# Blockchain Transaction System with Multi-Factor Login

A secure, full-stack crypto trading platform that demonstrates how blockchain technology and multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be combined to ensure transactional integrity and user protection. This project simulates ETH trading on the Ethereum blockchain using signed raw transactions while enforcing OTP-based login to guard against unauthorized access.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system allows users to:

* Register with a unique Ethereum address and private key
* Log in using multi-factor authentication (OTP)
* Buy and sell ETH with USDT (virtual)
* Execute real ETH transfers on a local blockchain (Ganache)
* Sign transactions with private keys (no unlocked accounts)
* View and sync ETH balances directly from the blockchain

All actions are logged, validated, and securely managed via smart transaction flows and server-side protection.

## 🔐 Key Features

| Feature                             | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔗 **On-Chain ETH Transactions**    | Real ETH transfers using `eth_sendRawTransaction`, signed with user's private key |
| 🔑 **Multi-Factor Authentication**  | Secure OTP-based login via email using PHPMailer                                  |
| 🔐 **Private Key Isolation**        | Each user has their own Ethereum keypair; no keys are exposed or reused           |
| 🔄 **Live Blockchain Balance Sync** | ETH balance fetched from Ganache using `eth_getBalance` and stored in SQL         |
| 🧠 **Smart Validation**             | All balances, OTPs, and blockchain state transitions are validated in PHP         |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Start Ganache CLI (with deterministic accounts):

ganache-cli -d

➤ Download: Ganache CLI

Install PHP Dependencies via Composer

composer install

➤ Download: Composer

Import SQL SchemaUse phpMyAdmin or CLI to import database/crypto_transaction.sql into MySQL.

Configure Email OTPSet up email credentials in send_otp.php using PHPMailer.➤ Download: PHPMailer GitHub

Run on LocalhostServe the project using XAMPP or any local Apache server:

http://localhost/crypto_transaction/

Register → OTP Login → Trade

## 📄 Security Architecture

* ✅ **Blockchain signing**: Private key used to sign ETH transactions with `ethereum-tx`
* ✅ **No unlocked accounts**: Ganache is accessed via raw RPC only
* ✅ **MFA enforced**: OTP sent via email is required to access user dashboard
* ✅ **SQL Sanitization**: All queries prepared with bound parameters
* ✅ **Balance integrity**: All ETH balances are fetched from Ganache, not faked
